"""Joining the layers the economic analysis needs.

A trial is almost never one file. The plan comes out of the office software,
the as-applied log comes off the seeder or the spreader, and the yield comes
off the combine months later — three passes over the same ground, logged by
three machines, at three different point densities, on three different days.

They cannot be joined point to point. The GPS positions never coincide, the
densities differ by an order of magnitude, and matching nearest neighbours
would pair a yield reading with whichever rate record happened to be closest,
which is noise. The join happens on a **common grid**: each layer is
aggregated into the same square cells, and the cells are matched.

Cell size is the one parameter that matters. Too small and each cell holds
too few records of the sparsest layer; too large and it spans two treatments
and averages them into a rate nobody applied. Twenty metres is a reasonable
default for strips two machine passes wide.

    ----------
    layers:
        Map of ``role -> Dataset``. ``yield`` is required; ``as_applied`` or
        ``plan`` supplies the rate. ``vigor`` is optional.
    cell_m:
        Side of the shared grid cell, in metres.
    min_points_per_cell:
        Cells below this many records in a layer are dropped from that layer,
        which keeps a single stray reading from speaking for a whole cell.
    columns:
        Optional override of which column to take from each role.
    min_purity:
        Minimum share of a cell's rate records that must agree on one treatment
        level. Cells below it sit on a strip boundary, where two rates mix, and
        are dropped.
    carry:
        Extra columns to bring across from the yield layer — a management zone,
        a soil class, a variety. Without them the joined table loses whatever
        would let the analysis split the field, and the response of two

        A point dataset, one point per joined cell, carrying ``yield``,

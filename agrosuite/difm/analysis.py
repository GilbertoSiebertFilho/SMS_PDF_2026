"""DIFM analysis of strip trials.

DIFM (*Data-Intensive Farm Management*) treats the commercial field as the
experiment itself: strips of different rates are applied with the grower's
own machine and the response is read off the yield monitor. The analysis
needs three precautions that set it apart from a small-plot experiment:

1. **Aggregation.** Point by point, GPS error and sensor noise dominate. The
   data is aggregated into cells or strip segments before any curve is fitted.
2. **Strip edges.** Where two rates meet there is mixing and neighbour
   effects. An inward margin discards that zone.
3. **Heterogeneity.** The optimum rate changes within the field. Analysing by
   zone is what economically justifies variable rate in the first place.

    A strip trial has a handful of planned rates, but the machine log records
    small wobbles around each one, and an as-applied layer aggregated per cell
    wobbles further. Grouping by the raw value would create dozens of one-point
    "rates"; grouping by level gives back the experiment's real design.

    The levels are found from the **density** of values along the rate axis,
    not from the gaps between neighbouring ones. Nothing was applied between
    60 and 120 kg/ha, so the histogram there is empty even though the extreme
    tails of the two treatments may nearly touch. Looking at counts survives
    that; looking at gaps does not, because a single stray reading in the

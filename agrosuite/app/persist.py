"""Saving a session to a project file and reopening it.

A session is hours of work: files opened, units declared, cleaning run and
judged, roles assigned, prices typed in, a trial laid out. Closing the app
used to lose all of it, and re-importing the raw files does not bring it
back — the cleaning report, the removal reasons, the roles, the reviewed
ticks and the strip layout exist only in memory. The project file captures
that whole state so the work can be picked up where it was left.

The file is one ZIP with the extension ``.agrosuite``: a ``manifest.json``
describing the session and one parquet file per dataset. Parquet rather than
CSV because CSV loses the very things that make a dataset usable again —
column types, datetime precision and the difference between an empty string
and a missing value. Geometry travels as WKB beside each dataset, which
round-trips coordinates bit for bit; GeoJSON would round them.

Nothing here decides *when* to save, and no function reads the clock: the
timestamp is passed in by the caller, so a saved file says what the caller
meant it to say and the library is reproducible under test.

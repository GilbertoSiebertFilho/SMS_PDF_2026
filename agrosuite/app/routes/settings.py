"""The settings the app keeps between runs, over HTTP.

Two of them: the folder projects are kept in, and whether the app saves the
session into it by itself. :mod:`agrosuite.app.settings` owns the file and
the rules; this module maps them onto the API, and makes sure that changing
the folder takes the project that is already written along with it — a new
folder that stays empty until the next change would leave the person looking
at two places for one project.

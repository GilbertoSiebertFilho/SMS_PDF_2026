"""The printable report over HTTP.

The page itself is built by :mod:`agrosuite.report`; this module decides
where the file goes, stamps it with the time, and turns refusals into
messages the interface can show. The unit set travels in the request rather
than being read from anywhere on the server, because the server holds no
display preference: the numbers on paper must match the numbers on the

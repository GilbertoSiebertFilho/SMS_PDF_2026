"""Project file endpoints: save the session, reopen it, start afresh, and
pick it up where it was left.

The library that writes and reads the file is :mod:`agrosuite.app.persist`;
this module only decides *where* a save goes, *whether* an existing file may
be replaced, and what to tell the user when either goes wrong. It also
remembers which file the session came from or last went to, so that
re-saving it asks nothing and reloading the page does not forget it, and it
looks at a file before the session is given up for it.

The app also saves by itself, into the projects folder
(:mod:`agrosuite.app.autosave`). Two ends of that live here: the start-up
reopen, which puts the last project back before anyone asks, and the view
state, which is what makes the reopened session look like the one that was
left rather than a list of layers on an empty map.

"""Elevation rasters: a DEM GeoTIFF in, terrain layers out.

A yield file carries one GPS altitude per logged point, along the track. A
DEM — from LiDAR, SRTM, a drone survey or the provincial elevation service —
carries a height for every cell of a grid, and when the user has one it is
the better source for a relief question. GeoTIFF is the format every DEM
comes in, and the one QGIS reads back, so this module speaks only that.

Reading is more than opening the file. DEMs arrive in geographic coordinates
(a cell that is 30 m tall and 19 m wide at 51 °N), in US survey feet, in
Web Mercator (whose "metres" are 1.6 ground metres at that latitude), or at a
resolution far finer than any relief question needs. Every terrain
derivative assumes square cells in ground metres, so :func:`read_dem`
normalizes all of that into one :class:`~agrosuite.terrain.grid.ElevationGrid`
and says what it changed. Writing is the way back: slope, landform classes
and the elevation grid itself go to QGIS, or into the folder next to the
yield map, as GeoTIFFs carrying the CRS and nodata so nothing has to be
guessed on the other side.

rasterio is imported lazily: the registry imports this module at start-up,
and the interface must not pay for GDAL until someone actually opens a DEM.

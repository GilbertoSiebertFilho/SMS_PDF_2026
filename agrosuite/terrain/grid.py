"""The elevation grid every terrain derivative is computed on.

A yield or as-applied file carries one GPS altitude per logged point, along
the track the machine drove. Nothing about relief — slope, curvature, where
water collects — can be read off scattered points directly, so the first step
is always the same: put the elevation on a regular square grid. Every later
module (slope, landforms, depressions, contours, zones) works on the
:class:`ElevationGrid` built here, which is why its geometry is spelled out so
carefully: row 0 is the north edge, cell centres are at half-cell offsets, and
``rowcol`` maps a cell centre to an integer index, exactly the convention a
GeoTIFF uses. A DEM read from disk and a grid built from points therefore look
identical to everything downstream.

Turning GPS altitudes into a grid is not just interpolation. Monitor altitude
is the least reliable number in the file: it spikes when the receiver loses
satellites, and it shifts by a constant between passes when the receiver
re-converges after a headland turn. :func:`grid_from_points` removes both
before gridding, and reports how much of each it found — the pass-offset
spread and the residual vertical noise are the honest quality indicators the
findings quote. Two more failures are caught by value rather than by
neighbourhood, because every neighbour agrees with them: a run logged at 0 m
or a no-data value (the receiver had no fix), and a whole pass sitting tens
of metres off the rest of the field; and an altitude quantised to whole
metres is recognised so its risers are not taken for spikes or slopes.

        Gaussian smoothing scale. By default just enough to bring the
        altitude noise measured in the file down to about 3 cm on the

        derivative and turns decimetre noise into nonsense, while every

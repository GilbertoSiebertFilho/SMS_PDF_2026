"""Contour lines and elevation profiles.

A contour map is the one picture of relief people already read without
training: the lines crowd where the ground is steep and spread where it is
flat, close into rings around a hilltop or a hollow, and bend up-valley where
water gathers. The slope, curvature and landform layers say the same things
in colour, but a farmer checking the analysis against the field trusts the
lines first, and a profile drawn between two clicks — "how far does it drop
from the gate to the slough?" — is the most direct answer to how the field
falls.

Two details decide whether the lines can be trusted. The interval has to
suit the field: 0.25 m on a prairie quarter with 3 m of relief gives a dozen
lines, on a hilly field it gives two hundred and the map goes black, so the
interval is chosen from the relief unless the user sets it. And the lines
have to stop at the field edge: contouring runs on a nearest-filled copy of
the grid so lines reach the last valid cell instead of stopping a cell short,
and every vertex whose nearest cell is outside the field is then dropped, so
nothing is drawn over the notch or the neighbour's land that the fill
invented.

Everything comes back as GeoJSON in WGS84, which the map draws directly and
:func:`contours_to_geodataframe` turns into the shapefile or GeoPackage the
export step writes.

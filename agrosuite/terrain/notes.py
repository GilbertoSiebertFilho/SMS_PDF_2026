"""What was done to a file while it was read, kept as facts until someone reads it.

Gridding a file leaves remarks behind — a swath width that had to be
assumed, a cell widened to fit the budget, the smoothing that took the GPS
noise out, readings that turned out to be two fields in one export. They
are provenance: the reader has to have them beside the numbers or the
numbers claim more than they can.

The trouble is that they are *sentences*, and a sentence carries its
numbers inside it. Written once, as the file is gridded, "the surface was
smoothed over 32.8 ft" is stuck in feet: the unit picker moves, every
finding around it is written again from the stored metric numbers, and the
note sits there in the set the file happened to be read in. That is the
one inconsistency the rest of the app does not have.

So a note is not stored as its sentence. It is stored as **the fact it
states** — a key naming the note and the metric quantities it needs — and
the sentence is written at read time, through
:class:`~agrosuite.core.units.Phrase`, in whatever unit set the reader is
working in. :func:`render` is what a report calls to say them again;
nothing is re-read and no stored number moves, exactly as
:func:`agrosuite.terrain.analysis.restate` does for the findings.

A note whose numbers are **counts, shares, CRS names or the name of a unit
the file declared** has nothing in it that moves with the reader, so it is
kept as the finished sentence through :func:`plain` — "668 of the 33 400
records carry an altitude that is not a number" says the same thing to
every reader, and rewriting it would only risk changing it.

"""The terrain analysis a user actually sees: one call, one result, one report.

:func:`analyze` takes a dataset — a yield or as-applied file with GPS
altitude, or a DEM read through :mod:`agrosuite.formats.raster` — and runs
the whole chain in order: grid, derivatives, hydrology, landform classes,
discrete hills and lows, contours. :class:`TerrainResult` holds the layers
for the map and turns them into the JSON summary the interface shows, the
plain-English :func:`findings` a farmer reads, GeoJSON outlines of the
features, and the zone datasets the rest of the app already knows how to
export to a monitor and join with yield.

Two decisions shape the numbers. The topographic position indices are
computed on the elevation minus the field's fitted plane: in the interior a
plane contributes nothing to TPI, but at the field edge the neighbourhood
disc is cut off on the outside, and on a tilted field the uphill edge would
otherwise read as a ridge and the downhill edge as a valley. And a hill (or
low) is only reported when it stands at least ``min_feature_height_m`` above
(below) the foot of the ground around it, a threshold that defaults to twice
the measured GPS noise — a bump smaller than the noise is the noise. The
same threshold floors the landform classes, the closed depressions and
the wetness index: a cell whose position index is within a fraction of it
reads as level ground; a basin shallower than it is counted but not
listed, because on an unsmoothed altitude the noise alone digs dozens of
"potholes" holding real-looking volumes; and a field whose whole residual
relief is under it gets no "likely wet" ground beyond what actually
ponds, because standardized indices always have tails and a dead-flat
field must not come back a tenth hilltop and a tenth wet. The wetness
index is ranked only over cells whose slope the surface can vouch for
(over twice its noise per cell), because where the slope is floored the
index is a constant, not a ranking, and a flat plain next to one hill
came back a tenth "likely wet". And every share of the field — slope
classes, aspect sectors, landform classes, wet ground — is taken inside
the field's outermost ring of cells, whose derivatives lean on copied
values (see :mod:`derivatives`); the layers keep the ring, the shares do
not, or a uniform 3 % plane reports 2 % of itself flat.
A field with no relief the data can vouch for at all — neither beyond its
general fall nor in it — is *level*: it gets no contour lines, drainage
lines, wet cells or features, and one finding says so, because every one
of those would otherwise be drawn from the rounding noise of the gridding
(a constant altitude column comes back as 953 contour loops around
differences of 1e-13 m).

Everything stored here is metric, the sentences included: :func:`summary`
writes them in metres, hectares and cubic metres, and the structured
numbers beside them are the same store an interface converts at display
time. A sentence cannot be converted at display time — its numbers are
written into it, and restating it in another unit means deciding again
what it says — so the reader's unit set travels into the writing of it
instead, through :class:`~agrosuite.core.units.Phrase`. :func:`findings`
takes that unit set, and :func:`restate` writes a stored summary's
sentences again for a reader who works in another one, from the numbers
the summary already carries and without touching a single one of them.

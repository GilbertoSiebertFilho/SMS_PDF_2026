"""Machine profiles: the numbers about a machine that never change between jobs.

A combine's header width, its flow delay and its working speed are properties
of the machine, not of the field, yet the app asked for them on every
cleaning and every trial layout. Typing "60 ft, 12 s" for the third time this
season is how a 6 sneaks in for a 60. A profile is entered once, checked once
and reused.

Profiles outlive the session, so they live on disk rather than in
``server.state``: ``$AGROSUITE_HOME/profiles.json``, defaulting to
``~/.agrosuite/profiles.json``. The file is plain, indented JSON on purpose —
it can be read, edited or copied to another computer with nothing but a text
editor.

Every physical value is stored **metric** (m, s, km/h), like everything else
in the app. The interface converts at display and at entry, so switching the
unit set never changes what is on disk.

"""Preliminary analysis, run the moment a file is opened.

Before anyone decides what to do with a file, they need to know what it is
and whether it is worth trusting. This module answers that in one pass, so
the app can say — without being asked — what came in, what is missing, what
looks wrong, and what the sensible next step is.

Three things it checks that matter most in practice:

**Are the units what they seem?**
    A mean yield of 55 on a canola map is bu/ac, not kg/ha. Reading it as
    kg/ha would put every later number out by a factor of fifty. The check
    compares the observed magnitude against what the operation and crop make
    plausible and names the unit that fits.

**Is anything missing that blocks the next step?**
    Cleaning without speed or swath width loses its best filters. A DIFM
    analysis without an applied rate cannot start at all. Saying so up front
    beats failing three screens later.

**Does the data look like one field, one job?**
    Two fields merged into one file, a fragment of a pass, or a logging gap
    of several hours all change how the numbers should be read.

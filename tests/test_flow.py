"""Two tracks, and nothing that blocks.

The app serves two jobs a season apart: planning a trial from a boundary,
and evaluating one after harvest. Neither is a gate. What these tests
protect is that promise in every layer it lives in — the workflow module
that models it, the first look that suggests the next step, the project
state the server reports, the tabs the interface draws — plus the rename
that took the acronym out of everything the user reads while leaving the
wire names alone, so a project file saved yesterday still opens.

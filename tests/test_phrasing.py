"""The app's own sentences, in the units the reader works in.

Every number this app stores is metric, and the interface converts it for
the screen. A *sentence* cannot be converted for the screen — its numbers
are written inside it, and restating one in another unit means deciding
again what it says — so the unit set travels into the writing of it, and a
stored report's prose is written again whenever someone reads it.

What these tests protect is that split:

* the same analysis, said in two unit sets, carries the same numbers and
  different words;
* nothing a reader on the Canadian default is shown quotes a metre, a
  hectare, a cubic metre or kg/ha, except where the sentence is *about*
  the file's own units and naming one is the point;
* the imperial sentence carries the converted value, not a relabelled one;
* an unknown unit is refused by name rather than quietly ignored;
* a project saved in one unit set opens in the one in force when it is
  opened, not the one it was saved in.

"""Leftovers from the second review pass, pinned here.

Three of them: the DIFM demo trial drawn at corn's ten tonnes a hectare while
the app opens on canola, so the first thing a new user saw was the app's own
check calling its own sample data wrong; the package endpoint answering with
``observacoes`` while the page read ``notes``, so the rate-conversion note
never reached the screen; and a handful of Portuguese defaults — ``Talhao``,
``Prescricao``, ``Produto``, ``Fazenda``, ``pacote_``, ``_contorno`` — that
went out in file names and ISOXML designators. The sweep at the end is what
would have caught them: it fails on the next one too.

The reload that left nothing selected is pinned in ``test_regression_fixes_ui``,
which drives it in a browser; it is not repeated here.

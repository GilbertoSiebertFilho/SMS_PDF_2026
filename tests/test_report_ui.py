"""The "Print report (PDF)" buttons in the interface, checked against the contract.

The interface is vanilla JavaScript and has no unit tests of its own; what
can be checked here without a browser is the contract it relies on. Every
field the page POSTs must be one the route accepts, every unit key it sends
must be one the report reads, each report must be printed from the dataset
that carries it, and the heading style the buttons sit in must exist. A
rename on either side would otherwise only show up in a browser.

"""The project-file controls in the interface, checked against the contract.

The interface is vanilla JavaScript and has no unit tests of its own; what
can be checked here without a browser is the contract it relies on. Every
endpoint the page calls must be one the router serves, the request it
POSTs must carry only fields the route accepts, the controls it binds must
exist in the page, and the two routes a project file can take in — the
path dialog and the upload input — must both turn away from import. A
rename on either side would otherwise only show up in a browser.
